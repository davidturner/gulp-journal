  <h1>Hi, I’m David Turner</h1>
  <p>I’m the CTO of <a href="https://getinvited.to/">Get Invited</a>, and creator of <a href="http://simply-written.com/">Simply Written</a> and <a href="https://referenceit.org/">ReferenceIt</a>. I dislike keeping useful knowledge a secret, and make a point of trying to share as much as possible. What use is knowledge, after all, if people can’t benefit from it?</p>
  <p>To that end I have created this journal where I can share my thoughts on design and development. My journal will contain tutorials, thoughts, and inspirations about the processes I use in my work. By sharing my work and my thought processes, I hope that others can learn from what I've done and improve upon it.</p>
