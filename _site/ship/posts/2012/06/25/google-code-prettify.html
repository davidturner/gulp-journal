<p>I’ve been playing with code highlighting with my site for a while now, and I found two that worked pretty well for what I wanted. [Google Code Prettify][0] is the first of these. It <em>doesn’t</em> quite do all the things that I would like it to, but it’s very small, very flexible, and very fast. Well worth checking out.</p>
