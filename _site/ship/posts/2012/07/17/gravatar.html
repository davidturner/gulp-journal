<p>Globally Recognized Avatars, AKA Gravatars, serve as a really easy way to implement avatars that are attached to your email address, not to an account on a site. It makes setting up avatars on sites simpler and gives people better control over what appears on sites. It’s pretty awesome and, if you’ve not already registered an account with them you really should.</p>
