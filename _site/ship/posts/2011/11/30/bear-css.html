  <p>Bear CSS is a handy little tool for web designers. It generates a CSS template containing all the HTML elements, classes &amp; IDs defined in your markup.</p>

<p>A rather snazzy tool designed &amp; developed by fellow Masters student <a href="http://kylegawley.co.uk/">Kyle Gawley</a> with illustrations from <a href="http://skipskap.com/">Jordan Henderson</a>. Upload an HTML file and itâ€™ll generate the CSS to let you style it. Pretty impressive stuff.</p>
