<p>Two weeks ago I was able to attend an event called <a href="http://www.nidesignalliance.com/events/the-design-question/">The Design Question</a>, organised by the <a href="http://www.nidesignalliance.com/">Northern Ireland Design Alliance</a>. I have previously written about <a href="/fear-of-the-circle-of-familiarity/">a realisation I came to</a> during the event. This post is the intended follow up. If you’ve not read it yet, it might be worth your while.</p>

<p>In my previous article, I spoke about my take on what went through my head about the <em>style</em> of the event. Today I’ll be going over what happened <em>at</em> the event as well as my thoughts on the questions that were asked, along with some of the things I <em>wish</em> I had said.</p>

<h2 id="the-theme-of-the-talk">The Theme of the Talk</h2>

<p>Before I dive straight into the event, and the questions, I thought it might be useful to recap what the event was actually <em>about</em>. Unless you looked at the <a href="/fear-of-the-circle-of-familiarity/">event listing</a>, or attended, you’re unlikely to know after all. The event dealt with the asking, and answering, of three questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“How the hell do I get a job in the design business?” - <a href="http://cargocollective.com/peterstrain">Peter Strain</a></li>
  <li>“‘Design Effectiveness’: Fluff or Fundamental?” - <a href="http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index.htm">Stephen McGowan</a></li>
  <li>“How can design affect our risk-averse, conservative culture in NI?” - <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/nitc/">Stephen McGilloway</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I’ll be taking a look at each of these in turn, and talking a little about what <em>I</em> thought about them. Whilst there was some <em>brilliant</em> input by people such as <a href="http://webstandardistas.com/">Chris Murphy</a>, I’ll be focusing on what I <em>should</em> have been saying rather than the words of others.</p>

<h2 id="the-actual-talk">The Actual Talk</h2>

<p>The talk itself was, as I’ve mentioned in other posts, <em>great</em>. It wasn’t a large event, and as a result it had a much more personal feel to it. I <em>felt</em> that I was a part of something, which is a rare feeling at events most of the time.</p>

<p>The whole approach to the event, and the level of participation, built upon this. Rather than being focused on a single person, or group of people, talking it was instead focused on asking and answering questions. These were posed by specific speakers and answered by <em>everyone</em> in attendance.</p>

<p>To an extent I found this personal approach <a href="/fear-of-the-circle-of-familiarity/">a little overwhelming</a> but, even with that, I thought it was a great event. I feel that my unease is a result of my realisation that I <em>need</em> to be more social with others than I currently am. Speaking to people <em>after</em> the event itself reaffirmed this thought.</p>

<h2 id="question-1--getting-a-job">“How the hell do I get a job in the design business?”</h2>

<p>This is a question that I believe I have a decent amount of experience with. I recently graduated from the Interactive Multimedia Design course, and walked straight into a job with <a href="http://www.freshmademedia.co.uk/">Fresh Made Media</a> along with my good friend <a href="http://simonf.co.uk/journal">Simon Fraser</a>. I know a few other people had similar luck too.</p>

<p>I didn’t really chip in with answering the question, something I regret in looking back. Some of what I feel helps with finding a job has been covered in my <a href="/advice-for-imd-students/">advice to IMD students</a>. It forms a good starting point for <em>one</em> approach to helping find a job.</p>

<h3 id="share-your-thoughts">Share Your Thoughts</h3>

<p>Ironically one of my points is being social, something I struggle with at these kinds of events. I put a <em>lot</em> of myself out online. I use the <a href="http://twitter.com/HerrWulf">twitters</a> and I try to share my thoughts either on there or here, on my journal. People can see not just <em>what</em> I think, but <em>how</em> I think.</p>

<p>Doing so <em>has</em> found me work, both as a freelance designer as well as with finding employment at <a href="http://www.freshmademedia.co.uk/">Fresh Made Media</a>. I was also approached about freelance work by other studios, but my workload was overwhelming and I wasn’t able to take on any additional work.</p>

<p>I attribute this to the fact that I <em>show</em> what I do, and I <em>show</em> that I care. Clients have told me that by talking about what I do, it helped them decide to work with me over much larger design studios. You can’t do this without talking.</p>

<h3 id="be-approachable">Be Approachable</h3>

<p>But posting stuff online is only a one-directional medium. That isn’t enough. To be offered work you <em>need</em> to be approachable. If people can’t get in touch, then how do they offer you work? You also need to ensure that people <em>want</em> to approach you.</p>

<p>The phrase “Don’t Be A Dick” is appropriate here, something I mentioned to <a href="/advice-for-imd-students/">IMD Students</a> and something that <a href="http://jessicahische.is/thinkingthoughtsaboutgettingfreelance">Jessica Hische</a> mentioned in a post of advice for getting freelance work. If people don’t like you, they won’t contact you. Don’t help people dislike you.</p>

<p>Being approachable isn’t just about letting people offer you jobs though. It’s about allowing for people to <em>talk</em> with you too. This could be via twitter, email or comments, or any other medium. Let people get to know you. Unless you <em>are</em> a dick, it isn’t going to hurt you.</p>

<h3 id="its-not-easy-getting-work">It’s Not Easy Getting Work</h3>

<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean you <em>will</em> find work. These are things that have helped me find work. They will probably help others too, but some people might choose to take a different approach. Not everyone travels the same way. The same is true with getting employment.</p>

<h2 id="design-effectiveness-fluff-or-fundamental">“‘Design Effectiveness’: Fluff or Fundamental?”</h2>

<p>The second question of the night was a lot harder to answer. To me it was harder to answer because the effectiveness of design can be difficult to measure. Even if we can agree that a design <em>is</em> effective, how do we measure the effectiveness of it as a whole? The effectiveness of it’s parts?</p>

<p>It was also difficult for me to think of an answer due to my inexperience in this field. Whilst I have done a not insignificant amount of design work, tracking how effective a project is has fallen to others to measure.</p>

<h3 id="design-is-difficult">Design is Difficult</h3>

<p>Difficult to measure that is. Was it the facelift given to the site that improved things? The content? Did more people just happen to <em>find</em> the site at the same time it was designed? There’s a lot of variables and, as people on the night said, quite often clients assume the cause.</p>

<p>To me it seems obvious that design is fundamental to a product, be it a site or something physical. Would the iPhone have done as well if it had looked like a BlackBerry? Probably not, just look at how phone design has shifted. Design <em>can</em> change things.</p>

<p>Design serves a purpose. It can make a great product greater. It can make a good product better. A great product doesn’t necessarily <em>need</em> to be designed, but it would be <em>greater</em> for going through the design process. Design can lift something higher than it would otherwise be.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-design-affect-our-risk-averse-conservative-culture-in-ni">“How can design affect our risk-averse, conservative culture in NI?”</h2>

<p>On the night, I seem to recall the question being “How can we avoid risk?”. I remember thinking that it was something of a stupid question to ask. Avoiding risk means, to me, that you avoid reward. Maybe I misheard the question, but I feel that the question on the event page is better worded.</p>

<p>The reason I find the “How can we avoid risk?” question stupid is because risk is <em>easy</em> to avoid. Take the safe path. <em>Don’t</em> try new things. I think that it would be foolish to take the safe path all of the time however. By avoiding risk you avoid doing new things. You stagnate.</p>

<h3 id="answering-the-original-question">Answering the Original Question</h3>

<p>Combatting a risk-averse culture isn’t an easy thing. Yet, at the same time, sometimes it is <em>so very easy</em>. Showing a confidence in something helps to calm those around you. Showing confidence can help others to <em>feel</em> the same confidence that you do. It’s not easy though.</p>

<p>Keep in touch with those you work with or for. This helps you to ensure that people <em>do</em> have faith in what is going on. It lets them know that they are a <em>part</em> of what is going on. And if they suddenly go quiet, it’s an indicator that people are worried about something. Talk with them about it.</p>

<p>As designers we seem to be continually adding to the list of things we undertake. I don’t see this as a bad thing though. Being able to talk with others, with your clients, is an important skill to have. And guess what? It might help you <a href="#question-1--getting-a-job">find a job</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>I’m really glad that I was able to attend this event. I didn’t really contribute much at the time, but it got me thinking. As you can see above, it’s gotten me writing again too. It was interesting to see a new format of event as well, something that <em>felt</em> more personal. I hope they do more similar events.</p>

<p>It was also nice to see so many different facets of design come together to discuss these questions. It’s all too easy to get tied up in being a web designer, or print designer. By talking as designers, be it from web, print, or an educator of designers, we all benefit. And that’s a good thing for everyone.</p>
