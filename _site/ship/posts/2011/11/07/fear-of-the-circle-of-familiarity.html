<p>I recently attended a rather awesome event put on by the <a href="http://www.nidesignalliance.com/">Northern Ireland Design Alliance</a>. It was called <a href="http://www.nidesignalliance.com/events/the-design-question/">The Design Question</a>, and dealt with asking, and trying to answer, a series of questions that related to what we do. It wasn’t a large event, and felt like it was much more personal. It felt <em>great</em>.</p>

<p>It was also a little daunting for me. The Design Alliance is a rather friendly group of people, both those running it and the members. This meant that people were able to talk to each other on a first name basis. I felt like the odd one out because I <em>don’t</em> know these people <em>that</em> well.</p>

<p>Google+ allows users to filter friends into circles. Sometimes it can feel like this at events too. It’s <em>not</em> an intentional thing, it’s an unfortunate consequence of familiarity. When everyone seems to know everyone else, it can be very offputting to the new guy.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s not as simple as that. At the event itself I surrounded myself with people that I <em>already</em> knew. I slotted myself perfectly into a social circle I’m already a part of. How can I get to know the people around me if I don’t put the effort in to do so? I’ll talk a little more about this shortly.</p>

<p>When I talk about this, I don’t mean to say that the event was in any way exclusive. The organiser, Sara Graham, did try (quite hard) to get us to chip in, and we eventually did. The <em>people</em> at the event were very social as well. Talking to them individually was great. Talking to them as a group was scary.</p>

<p>Facing something that unnerves or scares you can be quite difficult. It wouldn’t have the impact on you otherwise. I <em>did</em> speak up towards the end of the event, but it was on the question I was least comfortable answering. Whilst I’m comfortable with what I said, I feel that I should have spoken up during an earlier question.</p>

<p>Events are a <em>fantastic</em> opportunity to meet new people and make connections. I didn’t. Neither did the people I sat with for the most part. Whilst some of them didn’t know each other, I knew almost all of them and was able to quickly make introductions.</p>

<p>I can’t help but feel that I should have made a point of <em>trying</em> to introduce myself to people, to <em>try</em> and make new connections with people involved in similar fields to myself. Sure, I might not always succeed, but if I <em>never</em> try then I will <em>never</em> succeed.</p>

<h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2>

<p>In a way I’m appreciative that I was able to attend the event. Whilst I might not have contributed a lot, or networked a great deal, I did learn a lot from those around me. I also realised that I need to push myself to be more social at events. So I’m glad I learnt that at this event.</p>

<p><em>Why</em>? I have the pleasure of attending this year’s <a href="http://2011.buildconf.com/">Build</a> Conference, which runs over most of this week, and it’s a <em>fantastic</em> opportunity for me to change my ways. It’s also an awesome event, with awesome people both speaking and traveling here to participate.</p>

<p>Last year I was able to meet some pretty awesome people. I hope to do the same this year. If you see anyone standing looking awkward, feel free to approach them and strike up a chat. They’ll probably appreciate it.</p>
